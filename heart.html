       <h1>Heart</h1>
       <p>
       The heart is a muscle and vital organ in humans and other animals, and pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. The heart sits in the chest, in the mediastinum contained in the thoracic cavity of the thorax.

        <p>
       The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium which also contains a lubricating pericardial fluid. The outer wall of the heart is made up of three layers, the epicardium, the myocardium which is the muscle of the heart, and the endocardium. The heart is divided into four main chambers: the two upper chambers are called the left atrium and the right atrium (plural atria) and the two lower chambers are called the right and the left ventricle.[1] There is a dividing wall of muscle, called the septum, which separates the right side of the heart from the left side of the heart. The part of the septum that separates the ventricles, the ventricular septum is thicker than that which separates the atria, the atrial septum. The flow of blood is controlled by the heart valves.
