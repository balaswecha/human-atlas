       <p>
       The human gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract, is an organ system responsible for consuming and digesting foodstuffs, absorbing nutrients, and expelling waste.
       </p>
       <p>
       The tract is commonly defined as the stomach and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts.[1] However, by the broadest definition, the GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus.[2] On the other hand, the digestive system is a broader term that includes other structures, including the digestive organs and their accessories.[3] The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment.
       </p>
        <p>
       The GI tract releases hormones to help regulate the digestive process. These hormones, including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, indicating that the cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.[5]
